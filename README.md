# DEV-REV-TASK
## FrontEnd Role Task-Library Management System

### Problem Statement
Build a simple library management page where
 - Users should be able to see the list of books
 - Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of books (implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus)
 - Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date
 - User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria [ Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date]
