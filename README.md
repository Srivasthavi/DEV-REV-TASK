## FrontEnd Role Task-Library Management System
### Problem Statement
Build a simple library management page where
 - Users should be able to see the list of books
 - Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of books (implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus)
 - Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date
 - User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria [ Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date]

 [#note: Here is a detailed description about my thoughtprocess and what I did step by step to develop the front-end for this task.]
 
 ### Step-1: Identifying the basic elements needed and the design.
 
 The basic elements for the library management system website would be (according to the given problem statement as well.)
 - Navigation Bar with sign-up and login options.
 - The title of the website-which in this case would be - "Library".
 - Search bar option - with filters.
 - List of Books - with the details-[Title, Author, Subject and Publish Date]
 - Scroll Bar option
 - Pagination
 - Count of books available
 
 The design would be:
 - Identifying a good background picture. (I have noticed that in a lot of cases websites are more attractive, if the background is not just a color or a mix of colors but if it is a hd imgae and related to the topic and more visible if its in a darker shade and with a little bit of opacity.)
 - The aesthetic colors of the elements ,the fonts, and size should match to the background - match to the aesthetic vibe of the website.
 
 

 ### Step-2:
 
 Now, that we know what we and what we should do its time to implement our idea.

 1. html main page 
 2. css style sheet
 3. JavaScript file
 4. Json File- Data-List of books with its respective details
 5. Background image
 6. login and sign-up page - (this would be part of back-end using php and mysql server)
